# Projects

Place promoted, portfolio-quality work here. When something in `weeks/` becomes
stable and useful to show publicly, copy it here and polish the README.

Recommended structure inside each project:
```
<project-name>/
├─ README.md
├─ src/
├─ notebooks/
├─ data/        # keep small samples or synthetic data only
├─ tests/
└─ requirements.txt
```
